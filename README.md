# LEDClock & Temp
An Adaption of Nickâ€™s Pong Clock & Brett Oliver's Adaption

My Adaption is to display Temperature with a BMP180 attached on i2C (this is easy to change as there are numerous sensors out there)

MAJOR CHANGE - PONG Game is removed!

Plan is to build an Uno Shield (PCB) to share and simplify the design onto one circuit to plug
the Display, PIR and Thermostat into.

If you cant wait to use it, build as per Brett's instructions (although for memory reasons have had to remove some functionality)
and also, I found I outgrew a standard UNO so its running on a MEGA256.  
I need to seem how to trim this back. If anyone can help me with that please do!

Would love some help on tidying this up.
